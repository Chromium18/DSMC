DSMC_StaticDeadUnits 			= true		-- true / false

DSMC_UpdateStartTime_mode		= 2 		-- 1,2 or 3. Ignored if UpdateStartTime is false. 1 = keep continous scenery. 2 = start the next day, random hour. 3 = use current date, default mission time.

--> Choosing Auto-Save will make DSMC automatically desanitizatize MissionScripting.lua
DSMC_AutosaveProcess			= false		-- true / false. 
DSMC_AutosaveProcess_min		= 2			-- minutes, number, from 2 to 480. DSMC_AutosaveProcess must be true.

DSMC_automated_CTLD				= true	 	-- true / false. If true enable the inbuilt CTLD.
DSMC_automated_CSAR         	= true      -- true / false. If true enable the inbuilt CSAR scritp. Works only if DSMC_automated_CTLD is true

DSMC_CreateSlotHeliports    	= false     -- true / false. If true, helicopters slots will be automatically created on heliports. Check manual for details on how it works.
DSMC_CreateSlotAirbases     	= false     -- true / false. If true, slots will be created in airbase also and with fixed wing type. BEWARE: REQUIRE CONSISTENT SCENERY DESIGN! CHECK MANUAL

-- Debug. Leave this true only for bugtracking!!!

-- these additional configuration has effect ONLY when DSMC_UpdateStartTime = true and DSMC_UpdateStartTime_mode = 2
-- min & max is used to define the minimum and maximum hours used to randomize mission start time.

DSMC_DisableF10save				= true      -- true / false. F10 menÃ¹ save option disable switch

DSMC_StarTimeHourMin        	= 5         -- 1-> 14. hour 0-24 that will be used as minimum in the start mission time randomization, valid only with DSMC_UpdateStartTime set to true and DSMC_UpdateStartTime_mode set to "2". Out of the defined range, the value will be set as "4"
DSMC_StarTimeHourMax        	= 16        -- 15-> 23. hour 0-24 that will be used as maximum in the start mission time randomization, valid only with DSMC_UpdateStartTime set to true and DSMC_UpdateStartTime_mode set to "2". Out of the defined range, the value will be set as "16"

DSMC_WarehouseAutoSetup     	= true      -- true / false. If true, at each mission end the supply net will be automatically rebuilt. Check manual!

DSMC_DisableFog     	        = false     -- true / false. If false, DSMC weather system will create fog when could be expected due to moisture levels. If true, it will prevent fog formation in any conditions.

DSMC_CreateSlotCoalition    	= "all"     -- "all", "blue", "red". Case sensitive. If wrong, it reverts to "all". If blue or red, slots will be created only for that coalition

DSMC_24_7_serverStandardSetup   = 0         -- value, 0->24. 0 means disabled. Any values above 24 are read as 0. If a valid number between 1 and 24, it will automatically save the scenery & close DCS after that period in hours, and set the saved mission as first upon restart of DCS.
-- This option is a simplified setup for the specific server autosave layout, where:
---- variable DSMC_AutosaveExit_hours is equal to the specified values
---- variable DSMC_AutosaveExit_time is 0
---- variable DSMC_AutosaveExit_safe is true
---- variable DSMC_AutoRestart_active is false (since it's beta and not working currently)
---- variable DSMC_updateMissionList is true
-- Server admin with a auto-restart 24/7 setting should consider to use this instead of the single variables unless needed.

-- Specific server autosave and restart setting 
-- THESE VARIABLES WORKS ONLY IF DSMC_24_7_serverStandardSetup IS SET AS 0 (false)
DSMC_updateMissionList          = false     -- true / false. If true, once the server closes, DSMC will automatically update the mission list by setting only the saved mission as first one, and removing the others
DSMC_AutosaveExit_hours			= 25        -- value, 1->24 or 25. hours of simulation after with DCS closes, from 0 to 24 (higher values won't be accepted). If clients are online, it will delay 5 minutes and so on till nobody is online.
DSMC_AutosaveExit_time      	= 0         -- value, 1->23. hour at witch DCS will automatically close regardless of clients or other settings. works only if DSMC_AutosaveExit_hours is set to >24. Values out of the 1-23 range will be ignored.
DSMC_AutosaveExit_safe      	= true      -- true / false. If false, the autosaveExit will kill DCS even if there are clients online, for those server admin who prefer to have a specific kill time.
