Dynamic Sequential Mission Campaign (DSMC) is a tool for mission designers, supporting versions of DCS World 2.5.6 and above. This tool adds persistence to any DCS World mission, done by allowing the user to save the scenario at any moment and generate a new mission file based on the situation at the time of saving, that can be loaded, or edited, using the DCS mission editor. DSMC is required to be installed on the host/server only, and has configuration settings available for both Dedicated server, or Player as Host, via the special options GUI in DCS World.
DSMC creates a new .miz file that includes:
•	All original triggers, scripts and embedded files as the original 
•	Updated unit positions and states (alive, dead)
•	Scenery object states, like bridges, houses and structures
•	Updated airbases, Oil/Gas facilities & FARP ownership
•	Updated warehouse contents of fuel, aircraft & ammo
DSMC also includes improved features and functions for dedicated server mode, and for servers with desanitized missionscripting.lua settings.
DSMC does not support capturing aircraft or missiles in flight.


INSTALLATION

DSMC needs to be installed on the server or mission hosts computer only. It works with both DCS stable & openbeta versions. The following example references the DCS World Open Beta version.
The installation package is a zipped file to be copied “as is”. Installation is performed by copying “DSMC_main” folder content inside your Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\ folder. The mod files are:
•	DSMC folder
•	Script\Hooks\DSMC_hooks.lua file
•	Mods\tech\DSMC\ folder
•	DSMC_Dedicated_Server_options.lua file.
To allow faster install/uninstall procedures you may want to use JGSME or OvGME mod managers, which are fully compatible with DSMC.


COMPATIBILITY

DSMC is designed to be fully compatible with; 
•	Mist
•	MOOSE
•	LoATC
Special consideration was given to the CTLD script by Ciribob. To add additional features and automation, CTLD is already included in DSMC with some small additional features:
•	Automated helicopter, infantry group and APC/IFV recognition (no need to edit lua files)
•	Feel the weight! When you load troops into the helicopter, the helicopter weight is now dynamically added
•	All CTLD spawned items are retained in the saved mission and will continue to work in subsequent missions (FOBs cargo zones etc)
