DSMC - github repository

Dynamic Sequential Mission Campaign (DSMC) is a tool for mission designers, supporting versions of DCS World 2.7.7 and above. This tool adds persistence to any DCS World mission, done by allowing the user to save the scenario at any moment and generate a new mission file based on the situation at the time of saving, that can be loaded, or edited, using the DCS mission editor. DSMC is required to be installed on the host/server only, and has configuration settings available for both Dedicated server, or Player as Host, via the special options GUI in DCS World.
